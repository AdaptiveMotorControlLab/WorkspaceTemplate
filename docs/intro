# Introduction

This is the intro to the JupyterBook!

This is just a placeholder for you to document your package.


## Developer Guide

### 0. Edit your `config` and `toc` to your specs.

### 1. Set Organization-level Permissions (already done for SCENE)
Go to:
`Org Settings` → `Actions` → `General` → `Select the repo` → Check:

"Allow GitHub Actions to access the GITHUB_TOKEN with write permissions" must be enabled.

"Workflow permissions" must allow read and write by default, or per repo.



### 2. Deploy the Docs

First, this is done via the GitHub actions `publish-book.yml`.

To get a public `github.io` link, you must enable GitHub Pages.
Note, this only works for public repos, or if private, from paid org.

### Steps:

1. Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **"Source"**, select:

   * **Branch**: e.g., `main`
   * **Folder**: `/_build/html`
3. Click **"Save"**

GitHub will deploy your book and show a link like:
`https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

Deployment may take a minute. Refresh the page to see the live link!
